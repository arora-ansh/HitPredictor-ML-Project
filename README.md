# HitPredictor-ML-Project
Song Hit prediction model based on various acoustic and lyrical features. ML Course Project Monsoon 2021.

Tested on various Machine Learning classifers including :
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

Apart from the above, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were also tested as a classifier and gave really good results with 2 hidden layers.

Lyrics were extracted from Google APIs. Some analysis were done on them too :
- Topic modelling (LDA)
- K-Means Clustering (Along with other features)
- Sentiment Analysis

All the results are documented in the `models/` folder jupyter notebooks for reference. All the Reports and PPTs submitted for the project have been added to the `reports/` folder. The weights and plots can be found in the `weights\` and `plots\` folders respectively.
