I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah

Side bitch out of your league too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah

I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don't really listen

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

In the backseat of your Rover

From your roommate back in Boulder

Cuando estás bien te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola y siempre estoy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tienes ahí
Oye, baby, no seas mala
No me dejes con las ganas
Se escucha en la calle
Que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas

Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo
Que en esta relación soy yo la que manda
No pares bola' a toda esa mala propaganda

And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart

I’m never gonna find my way
If I don’t run to that goal
The past is the past, today is today
And there’s things I can’t control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth that I've been trying to hide
I’ve been waiting for you way too long
Won’t you come and take me home
Oh I, I’m praying this ain’t all a dream
Can you, you, wake me up before you leave

Why are you keeping me at a distance?
All that I'm asking for is forgiveness
Are you even listening? Am I talking to myself again?
I keep on staring up at the ceiling
Waiting for you to give me some kind of reason
Are you even listening? Am I talking to myself again?

Where are you now? Shed a light on me

I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing

I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

I'm beyond all that fuck shit, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
[Chorus: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch, get off me (goddamn)
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli (goddamn)
Yeh, I know your baby mama fond of me (goddamn)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli (goddamn)
Whispered in my ear, she tryna leave with me (goddamn)
Tell her I can get that pussy easily (goddamn)
Tell her I can hit that shit so greasily (goddamn)
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily (damn)

I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

In the middle of the party, bitch, get off me (off me)
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli

Yeah, I know your baby mama fond of me (she fond of me)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
(the weed, the weed)
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me

Said I can hit that shit so greasily (oh yeah, oh yeah)

He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Pre-Chorus]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

[Chorus]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put

You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien  with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus]
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

[Verse 3]
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

[Chorus]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

[Breakdown]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only twenty-nine, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga (Yeah)

They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now (Hatin' now)
She was playin' with me then but she waitin' now (21, 21)
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now (Mansion)
I was fightin' niggas then but I'm sprayin' now (Blastin')
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss (Nope)
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch (Broke)
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit (21)
They the type to stand in line for some free shit (Broke bitch)
Baby girl gon' suck it till her jaws locked (Suck it up)
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block (Fuckin' up)
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin' (21)

I don't need love, I'm the GOAT, I just hit the beat and float
And I'm sellin' out arenas but you puttin' on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
'Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smokin' in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now I'm cheese
I'ma turn this TSX into a Benz soon
I'ma see a lot of blessin's for my friends soon
Hunnid-fifty-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1"", man, a nigga need some leg room

So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

I'm too fucked up, I can't even tolerate myself

And my mama's worried 'bout me, but I ain't scared to go to hell
Only God can judge me, it's just I, me and myself, yeah
It's just I, me and myself
I love my lil' brother, he remind me of myself

Long lines on AC Transit, I put that Illmatic CD on
Lookin' out the window, at the walls they put graffiti on
Passin' by the billboards I knew one day I would see me on
But until then, just keep keepin' on
Easier said than done, I was the one they kept on sleepin' on
Told me keep dreamin' on
Back then, I had Girbauds, a 3X tall tee, and a beanie on
Who knew that me, myself and I would make it here? That's crazy
A lot of shit has changed since the version I had Bebe on
Love my lil' brother, born a day apart and three years
Both Gemini twins, everything we been through, we share these tears
Every time I look at him, it feel just like I see mirrors
Been through thick and thin, and he helped me get through all these fears, for real

You know, uh
Now it's just I, me and myself
They couldn't teach me this, I had to learn to like bein' myself
Got through that self-doubt, now I'm just fine bein' myself
I couldn't look to them, had to go and find me in myself
Well, now I got it though
Put 'em skeletons in my closet and told 'em, ""Adiós""
Let 'em keep the Prada shoes 'cause I was never proud of those
Made it through those sloppy joes, made it out them stop and goes
Ice cream with the baddest hoes remind me of the rocky roads
I took the scenic
Crazy to call it crazy 'til they get it, then it's genius
And I might be the rapper, but she payin' for all her features
I, me and myself, the only people I believe in
You know, yeah

Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks

Drive highways and byways to be there with you

Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm

Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door
[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—

I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well, motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn
[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

Súbete, súbete, súbete
Remix

[Verso 1: Maluma]
Dime si algún día sentiré tu cuerpo otra vez
Algo me dice que quieres volverme a ver
Hey, oye baby
Desde esa noche no paro de pensar en ti
Tú bien sabes que yo soy tu hombre porque él no te hace sentir

[Pre-Coro: Piso 21, Maluma]
Él nunca supo amarte como yo lo sé
Él no conoce cada espacio de tu piel
Sé que no soy perfecto pero te diré
Él no sabe cómo tratar a una mujer

[Coro: Piso 21, Maluma]
Cuando tú quieras me llamas, tú me llamas
Soy el que te dio amor y el que te lo da hoy
Cuando tú quieras me llamas, tú me llamas
Soy el que te dio amor y el que te lo da hoy

[Verso 2: Piso 21]
Soy el que te robó un beso en una noche lloviendo
Mojados terminamos haciendo el amor
Mi piel extraña tu cuerpo y mi boca tus besos
Dime, tú, si me extrañas como lo hago yo
[Verso 3: Maluma]
Y-y dime, mamacita, que tú quieres que te haga, mamá?
Hacemos travesuras hasta que no puedas más
Baby, de tu casa yo te voy a sacar
Y si tu madre te pregunta dile que te voy a robar
Pídeme el cielo y te lo doy
A la misma luna, por ti, yo voy
Todo lo que quieras, aquí estoy
Escucha este remix del Pretty Boy

[Coro: Piso 21, Maluma]
Cuando tú quieras me llamas, tú me llamas
Soy el que te dio amor y el que te lo da hoy
Cuando tú quieras me llamas, tú me llamas
Soy el que te dio amor y el que te lo da hoy

[Verso 4: Piso 21]
‘Toy loco por sacarte de esta soledad
Y darte de esos besos que él ya no te da
Tú, llama cuando quieras que aquí voy a estar
Y se te hizo un daño lo voy a arreglar
Yo sé que estás para mí y yo soy para ti
No dejemos morir lo que tenemos aquí

Él nunca supo amarte como yo lo sé
Él no conoce cada espacio de tu piel
Sé que no soy perfecto pero te diré

Cuando tú quieras me llamas, tú me llamas
Soy el que te dio amor y el que te lo da hoy
Cuando tú quieras me llamas, tú me llamas

Never thought that I would love again
Never thought I'd see the end of grain
Now I know I gotta get away
I need to kill the pain
Wanna see what's on the other side
Gotta know that there is more to life
Come along and open up my eyes
I wanna see the fire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm calling for you desperately
To save me and be my remedy
And take me to a better place
And come with me

[Chorus]
We are young, on the run
Let the love free your mind
We can be who we are
Like we never will die
When the sun's coming up
We'll be higher than stars
And I wanna wake up where you are

[Verse 2]
Hold me close and never let me go
Wanna dance until the high runs out
We're not ready for the afterglow
So hit me one more time
If tomorrow ever gets me down
Gotta keep on being on the run
'Cause I wanna live without a line
Between the moon and sun

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Release me, kill my misery
And redirect my destiny
We're heading for a better day
So far away

We are young, on the run
Let the love free your mind
We can be who we are
Like we never will die

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein

Know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)

I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow, pow)

Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you

'Cause you know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)

Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out

Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor

Running out of pages in your passport

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, ""sell dope, rap or go to NBA""
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen..."

[Intro: Maluma]
Ya no sé qué hacer
No sé con cuál quedarme
Todas saben en la cama maltratarme
Me tienen bien, de sexo me tienen bien

[Coro: Maluma]
Estoy enamorado de cuatro babies, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera
Estoy enamorado de cuatro babies, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera

[Verso 1: Noriel]
(Noriel)
La primera se desespera
Se encojona si se lo echo afuera
La segunda tiene la funda
Y me paga pa' que se lo hunda
La tercera me quita el estrés
Polvo corridos siempre echamos tres
A la cuarta de una, le bajo la luna
Pero ella quiere con Maluma y conmigo a la vez
Estoy enamorado de las cuatro
Siempre las busco después de las cuatro
A las cuatro les encanta en cuatro
Y yo nunca fallo como el 24
De los Lakers siempre es la gorra
De chingar ninguna se enzorra
Estoy metio' en un lío, y hasta confundio'
Porque ninguna de mi mente se borra

[Verso 2: Bryant Myers]
(Ah!)
Me pongo las gafas Cartier, saliendo del aeropuerto
Vestio' Giuseppe, zapatos en piel
Tú tienes todas mis cuentas de banco y el número de la MasterCard
Tú eres mi mujer oficial, me tiene enamorado ese culote con ese pelo rubio
Pero tengo otra pelinegra que siempre quiere chichar
A veces hasta le llega al estudio
La pelirroja chichando es la más que se moja
La encojona que me llame y no lo coja
Peleamos y me bota la ropa y tengo que llamar a cotorra pa' que la recoja
Tengo una chiquitita nalgona con el pelo corto
Me dice papi vente adentro, si me preña
(Bryant Myers)

[Coro: Maluma]
Estoy enamorado de cuatro babies, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera
Estoy enamorado de cuatro babies, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera

[Verso 3: Juhn]
Y estoy metío en un lío
A todas yo quiero darle
Me tienen bien confundío
Ya no sé ni con cuál quedarme
Y es que todas maman bien
Todas me los hacen bien
Todas quieren chingarme encima de billetes de cien
Me tienen en un patín
Comprando en San Valentín
Ya me salieron más caras que un reloj de Ulysse Nardin
Es que las babys están dura' y ninguna de la' cuatro se ha hecho completa
Dos tienen maridos y ninguna de las dos al marido respetan

[Verso 4: Maluma]
Cuatro chimbitas, cuatro personalidades
Dos me hablan bonito, dos dicen maldades
Diferentes nacionalidades
Pero cuando chingan gritan todas por iguales
Quiere que la lleve pal Medallo
Quiere que la monte en carro del año
Que a una la coja, a la otra la apriete
Y a las otras dos les dé juntas en el baño
Digan qué más quieren hacer
El Dirty las va a entretener
En la casa gigante, hay un party en el yate que él quiere tener
No sé si me entiendes, bebé

[Coro: Maluma]
Estoy enamorado de cuatro babies, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera
Estoy enamorado de cuatro babies, siempre me dan lo que quiero
Chingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero
Dos son casadas, hay una soltera
La otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera

Speaking my truth, there's no need to panic

From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?

Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

Our love was strong as a lion
Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron
You and I
Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk 'til the morning
You and I

[Pre-Chorus]
We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating, had it repeating

[Chorus]
You were my September Song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September Song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station
Passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers
You and I

Still, I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating, got it repeating

To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go

Solid as I'm waving, solid as I'm waving
So I became a liar, I've been underrating
Overestimated
I made it really hard for you
Hard for you to love me
But there's so many things we could do
And all we need is escaping, escaping

[Chorus]
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Eh-ah, eh-ah
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Eh-ah, eh-ah
Instead of you

Eh-ah, eh-ah, oh

On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you

On the blackened afternoon

Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, now I will bleed

Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back (back) pack (pack), fat (fat) cat (cat), crushin'

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Verse 2]
Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging, come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love

[Bridge]
Yeah
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than a Southern California day
Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta  be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
And you let her go
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
When you let her go
Whoa

Only know you love her when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

[Chorus]
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold

(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

I want you to know it's enough for me

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Outro: Eminem, Nate Dogg, Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me"

Ay, ¡Fonsi! ¡D.Y.!
Ooh, oh, no, oh, no, oh
¡Hey, yeah!
Dididiri Daddy, go!
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (¡D.Y.!)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
¡Oh!
Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (¡Oh, yeah!)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Estribillo: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube; sube, sube)
[Post-Estribillo: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woh, eh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woh, eh)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito', favorito', baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Eh; woh, eh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woh, eh)
Y que olvides tu apellido (Rrr; D.Y.)

[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo (Eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (Eh), mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam-bam
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe (Eh-eh; ¡plo!)
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

[Pre-Estribillo: Daddy Yankee]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito (Oh-oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (No, no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye! (Yo', yo'; ¡plo!)
[Estribillo: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito (Yo')
Deja que te diga cosas al oído (Yo')
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo (Plo, plo)
Despacito (¡Plo!)
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito (Yeah-eh)
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube)

[Post-Estribillo: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Eh, woh, eh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woh, eh)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito', favorito', baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Eh, woh, eh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woh, eh)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Puente: Luis Fonsi]
Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten: ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo
¡Báilalo!
[Outro: Daddy Yankee & Luis Fonsi]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito (Oh, yeah-yeah)
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (No, no; oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
Favorito', favorito', baby (Ooh)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (D.Y.)

I don't blame you
We got carried away
I can't hold on
To an empty space

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim]
Now you've found a new star to orbit
It could be love
I think you're too soon to call us old
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

[Chorus 1: Oliver Sim]
And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

[Post-Chorus 1: Oliver Sim & Hall & Oates]
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body

Dare me to, dare me to

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft]
My young heart chose to believe
We were destined
Young hearts
All need love
Call it a lesson
The stars and the charts
And the cards make sense
Only when we want them to
When I lie awake staring in to space
I see a different view

Now you've found a new star to orbit
It could be love

Before it slips away

[Chorus 1: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Say something loving
I just don't remember the thrill of affection
I just don't remember
Say something loving
I need a reminder, the feeling's escaped me

[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one
When I gave up, I found love

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
The thought flows through my mind
And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
To feel this weak, to be this nervous

[Chorus 2: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
You say something loving
It's so overwhelming, the thrill of affection
Feels so unfamiliar
You say something loving
Without hesitation it hits me, hits me
It feels so unfamiliar
[Post-Chorus: Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away

[Verse 3: Romy Madley Croft]
Your touch stays on my skin
I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave

[Verse 4: Oliver Sim]
Were you really looking for me?
Try your best to reassure me
I wasn't patient to meet you
Am I too needy, am I too eager?

[Interlude: Romy Madley Croft & Oliver Sim]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Did you hear me say it?
Say it
Did you hear me say?
[Chorus 3: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
I say something loving
I can't hold it inside, the thrill of affection
Is only getting stronger
I say something loving
All my hesitations are fading, fading
I feel it taking over

Don't let it slip away

A small-town kid'll come along

You'll get up off the ground
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

But a millionaire under 30 so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power—how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit: I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the G.O.A.T. while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, ""late"" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
Trump's a bitch, I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, ""wait,"" pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

Taking my sulkin' to the masses

Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain

I am ready right now
Uh huh
I look up I don't even know no more
I think it's funny how it go down
I don't even know no more, official shit

[Chorus]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 1]
I'm the livin' proof
That you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed
My daddy tell me, ""Stay strong, son
And be the man you have to be
Holdin' ship down, don't crash at sea""
Brrrt! Paper on my phone line
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me
Don't ask for me
Lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong
So don't ask for me

That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 2]
She been mad, I've been on the go, on the road
On a roll more than a roller coaster
They can't throw me off track or slow
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes
That quote on quote, say I told you so
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
Still smokin' at 5:20 like it's 4:20
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett
I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tungsten, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with
Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
My stock's risin', I'm goin' public, if I write it, it's gon' publish
You're fuckin' with the best, no discussion

So disgusting
It's that 3 and a third shit
Straight up

What's in common is they both pay respect to me
I get it my way from Friday to Friday
My girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade
I came a long way from that ""Marvin and Chardonnay""
I pull out the driveway like I’m in a car chase speeding!
And if my bitch cheat she know I’m leaving!
No text, no call boy

No peacoat, no time to change clothes
Same clothes, love if you living by the same code
G-code, leave ho

So when you see me, know you're somebody I'll never need

Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

Then you left and we turned rivals, now you back it's our revival

Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass, glass
Honestly, I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play the blame game
Point the fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame

I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this, I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

[Refrain: Big Sean]
You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Chorus: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine

No matter how much they gon' shade you

Got the whole city on fire
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man
Since I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

[Refrain: Big Sean]
So when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, and hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Chorus: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
No, man they can't fuck with the light
Hell nah, the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you
[Outro: Jeremih]
Don't let them take away your soul
No, no (No, no)
Don't let them take away what makes you whole"

[Chorus]
Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
(You know better, what the fuck!)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

[Verse]
This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me 'bout
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit

[Chorus]
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
(Yeah, you know what's about to go down)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck
(That's your problem, you don't listen!)
[Part 2: ""Stick to the Plan""]

[Intro]
Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 1]
Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracted
Put that into what's worth having (boy)
[Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 2]
Stay focused (stay focused)
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)
[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head"

[Puente: Ozuna]
Te pone una trampa
Primero se deja querer
Te eleva hasta el cielo
Y luego te deja caer
Y deja una huella donde quiera que pase
A veces buena, a veces mala
Pregunta bien

[Coro: Ozuna]
Le dicen ""la rompe corazones""
Falsas ilusiones
No esperes que cambie con el tiempo
Se acostumbró a que la perdonen
Le dicen ""la rompe corazones""
Falsas ilusiones
No esperes que cambie con el tiempo
Se acostumbró a que la perdonen
[Verso 1: Daddy]
Mencionan su nombre y el diablo se esconde
Ve como un trofeo a todos los hombres
Dice que te ama y es que algo se trama
Te tiene dormido haciéndote la cama
To' lo que se propone, ella lo consigue
Quiere enamorarse y no se decide
Puedes bajarle el cielo y no hay quien la obligue
Caíste y es difícil que tú la olvides

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee, Ozuna]
Y empieza su venganza
Cuando se gana tu confianza
Intenta pero su corazón no tranza

No sabes lo que te espera
Hay sorpresas en la caja de Pandora

Quizás te cures con el tiempo

And when you feel something you can't see
But you know it's meant to be
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me yeah
Bigger than me, bigger than me
When the whole family depend on you to eat
And at night you can't sleep
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Get it, get it, get it
I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister
I see myself in the young ones
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror
Corleone all on my own (Don)
Cartier all on my arm
All I hear is sirens  and car alarms
Niggas going to war with no armor on
First time I seen a dead body I was 14
And I felt the pressure
Like if I don't get it, I might end up next to him
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around
The hood America's lost and found
Where niggas get lost and never found
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and a Mercedes key
Got it and I still felt incomplete
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

But lost my time
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

Man that shit pathetic
God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man
If I ain't special why I feel it then?
I gotta get on the road
I gotta be the one chose
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah

[Myra Anderson:] In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything

[Myra Anderson:] Yeah
[Big Sean:] With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it so I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up, with that mindset, you know, it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day.

Sext me on the beach in Turks and Caicos

I'm about to show him what I do with that tongue

When my skin grows old
When my breath runs cold
I'll be thinking about you

[Verse 1]
Seconds from my heart
A bullet from the dark
Helpless, I surrender
Shackled by your love
Holding me like this
With poison on your lips
Only when it's over
The silence hits so hard

Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
It's so natural
Tastes like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick

'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]

If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

You say that I'm paranoid
But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
It’s not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

Misbehaving with your freak

Stop comparing my career

Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the 6
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got Firm niggas, Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn

Dime cómo le explico a mi destino que ya no estás ahí

Esta locura que siento por ti
Con esta química que haces en mí
Y ya no puedo, girl, ya no puedo, girl

Nena discúlpame si te ilusioné yo no lo quise hacer
Sé que en el amor cuando es real ese vuelve, vuelve (Vuelve, vuelve)
Pero cómo olvidar tu piel y cómo olvidarte mujer
Ya no puedo, girl, ya no puedo, girl

Sin mirar atrás, sin buscar a nadie más
Sólo quiero estar contigo, wouh
Si no te tengo aquí conmigo yo no quiero ser tu amigo
Porque tú eres mi camino, wouh
Y yo sólo quiero estar junto a ti
Nena, por favor entiéndelo
Sólo dame tu mano y confía en mí
Si te pierdes sólo sigue mi voz
Y dale tiempo (Tiempo), mami, al tiempo (Tiempo)
Que tú, que yo, estamos hechos para estar los dos
Y dale tiempo (Tiempo), baby, al tiempo (Tiempo)

Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, ""Boy I think the money's startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, ""Watch what they do for the ones""
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh, yeah

I might end up with your ho if I take one (Still comin')
Now days if they don't have a story, they gon' make one (Still comin')
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one (Still comin')
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one (Still comin')
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones (Yeah, comin')
'Cause now days if they don't got it they'll make one (Still comin')
The only time I feel alive when I take (Still comin')
I wanna vent but I know it ain't safe (Still comin')
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am? (Do you know who I am?)
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (Never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? (Give you my t-)
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (No videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (I invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

They take my kindness for weakness

We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you (Keep comin')
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too (Keep comin')
Told me, ""Boy I think the money startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground

My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (he was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (gave you chances)
I call for loyalty, she didn't ever answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies

I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me

Should've looked after your kids (Your kids)
Get out the booth, go home to your son (Son)

You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you've finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman

So let me give it to ya

And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone

While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment"

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Bridge]
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
[Pre-Chorus]
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""

Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here

And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my

When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

Don't care about religion

Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs

From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I

I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm

I don't need no, fake
Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for the snakes, yeah

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop ""Another One"", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
""Back to Back""? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah
Left the operating table, still look like ""nah""

I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, never been no fraud
Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, ""What up, Killa?""
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, ""Man, why him?""
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know

I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call

I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

Uh, I am not a fraud, YM, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, ""Alright, alright, alright""
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, ""Babe, I think I love you, kinda""

Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves

Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
Till all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting, running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

Everybody high five, everybody wanna smile
Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no
Oh, now you wanna chill? Oh, now you wanna build?
Oh, now you got the bill? That's cool though
Oh, now you got the gas? Oh, now you wanna laugh?
Oh, now you need a cab? That's true though
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet

You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a Lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money?
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space now

And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

Almost gave up on the music thing

You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?""
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high."

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?

Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary
More Life"

You proved her right, every single night

Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do

Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next

I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up, I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about it 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

Who feels like I did, never the cool kid
This song's for anybody
Who fought their way through, always remained true

The one's who trying to get it, the one's who dream it and live it
This song's for anybody
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song

[Intro]
Rrrrrr, hah, is gewoon Boef man

[Verse 1]
Ha, jij bent vies maar ik doe gemener
In de club, kom je moeder tegen
En ik wil snel weg want we moeten wegen
En je klant is geholpen, je moet vroeger wezen
Ik was alles kwijt, maar met floes herenigd
Voor me zondes af en toe gebeden
Ik ga uit eten voor een goede prijs
Ik ben een uitgever, ze boeken mij
Van alarm voorzien aan de achterkant
Dus ze komen via voor, maar wat dacht je dan?
Voor die goldies zet ik brakka's man
Ik was op streets en dat nachtenlang
Hier zijn de nachten lang, en de dagen kort
Ik heb slaaptekort want ik slaap te kort
Ik maak het af of ik maak het op
Hoe ze likt aan mijn banaan, maakt me apetrots
Word ik vandaag gezocht, dan ben ik morgen weg
Ik haal je kluis, niet je zorgen weg
Weet nog die dagen ik was onbekend
Nu aan de top terwijl je onder bent
Ik moest zo vaak racen van de police man
Maar nu ben ik verzekerd, ik heb polis man
Ja, grip op de scene, ik ben dominant
Sofiane, maar die tatta's zeggen Sofie-Jan

Gefocust, ik ben dedicated
Altijd al op buit, niet met sletten bezig
Jij slaapt op mij, nooit in bed gebleven
Alles of niets, ja zo denken velen
In mijn buurt is er cash maar wie trekt het meeste?
Beter in de grond of in flatten steken
Rip deal, ja ze kunnen je in je flatten steken
Ik had troep maar nooit met de bende bezig
Ik was op de streets, ik leek eng bezeten
Voor die shit, die ik nu bezit
En ik vroeg een mil, maar ik heb fans gekregen
Dus je snapt toch dat ik dit voor jullie spit
Koud broer, zelfs als ik in juli spit
Voor vakantie ben ik weer in julispits
En ik draag die 9, wie is jullie spits?
En ze praten wel, maar toch doen jullie niks (nee!)

Na ""Lauw"" was ze echt verliefd
Je speelt die hele man maar je bent het niet
Geen diploma, dan ga je moeten rennen vriend
Wordt gepakt in de winter, ziet de lente niet
Je waggie wordt verhuurd en verkocht
Eerst opgeslagen in een schuur of een box
Dan alles kwijt, breng het puur of met moks
Breng het duur naar de shop, in mijn buurt vind je cops ja..
Of ze vinden jou
Welloe cash broer, investeer in goud
En er wordt veel gesjouwd, soms gaan dingen fout
Hoef je verklaring niet te zien, reken blind op jou
Flash me één keer, nooit dat ik je weer vertrouw
Je snapt het niet, dus ik leer het jou
En je bent niet aan, wat forceer je nou?
Die Philipp Plein shirt, die is teringoud

Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

[Verse 2: French Montana]
You ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo for 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So, you don't ever hurt nobody
Baby girl, work your body, work your body

[Refrain: Swae Lee & French Montana]
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi
Why not?

Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA

Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA

See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son

Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)

Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me

We ain't got no time to waste
Poppin' your gum on the way (love me)
Am I in the way?
I don't wan' pressure you none
I want your blessing today (love me)
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way (love me)
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like a exit away, yep

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

God bless America, you know we all love him
Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap

The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll aks again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera

Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care

I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""

Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs

Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom"

Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
*Gunshot*

All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha
I’m biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead
Glover instead
Like what's up
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more
[Chorus]
I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don’t belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don’t know what's up

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes, sir,"" not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-

Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)

I feel like I'm out of my mind

I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore"

[Outro: Killer Mike]
Dear God, I just wanna know why
Why do you put us here?
Why do you put us below?
Why do you put us subservient?
Why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers?
And then we crawl and we scratch our way out
We betray each other
We lie, we take from one another
And we told you gon' forgive us at the end
But the state don't forgive us
I'm locked up and half my friends
And then when I get out, or I make it out
I'm expected to somehow give back
To people who never wanted to see me escape
I'm startin' to hate the man in the mirror
And it's gettin' clearer
That society was designed to keep me on the bottom
So, if you real, if you're out there for real
Please explain to me why
Why do we suffer? Why do we die?
And why do the people
Who go against everything you ever said always get ahead?
I've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right
But tonight, I am in this church
Asking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me
Because I'm tired and I don't know what else to do
So black I'm blue, so brown I'm down
I done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up
I am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame
And all I wanna do is believe in you
The darker you are, the closer you are to dirt
And they make sure it hurts
And I am tired of hurtin', man
I'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared
So if you out there, do something about this
'Cause I can't take it no more
Help me"

""Fuck it, I’ma steal this land""

[Outro]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that, right?
And I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn’t be shit!
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
For every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and, and all this
Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
But spend four, five, six hours of that
Working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No-no!
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy
You ain’t never experienced that shit
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there
Oh no, no, we know, we weren’t there
We didn’t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
Of what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black)
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah
And he’s here to say:
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior, fine
Just stop killing each other"

In the shadow of a nation that it once was
All this false information I'ma unplug, young blood
It is not love, up at TrumpThugs, dot gov
The man in the high castle in a hot tub
We locked in a pine casket, it's botched up
Like plastic surgery, classic perjury
The way they can plead the fifth to the 13th
And stop to search me, controversy
Them boys in the klansmen hoods is thirsty but hey motherfucker

Young blood, it takes another look and feel
Slap that fear monger at that wheel
Olive branches in the arrow seal

Gotta to go to ban the whole
Refugee population from the land they stole
In the name of the government
Rich white man while the rest be suffering
Run from the locked down borders
Ain’t like Flint ain’t got clean water
Dirty politics never come clean

George bush don't care about black people
2017 and Donald trump is the sequel so
Shit, I'll say what Kanye won't
Wake the fuck up and give the people what they want
Man it's all love but the youth is confused
Your music is 20/20 but them political views
Is blurred I ain't trying leave ya name slurred
'Cause honestly I idolize you on everything, my word
But I gotta say what need be said
'Cause I ain't fuckin with that hat, with the colors that’s white and red
I know some people wish I’d act white instead
Say I’d use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead
Fuck that, everything I do, I do it right
To teach the people that they have the power to fight
And not with semi automatic bullets in the night
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact
Nobody treated equally, especially the black
If you don’t get it the first time, bring it back
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites
To make it happen though we gon' need patience
And not violence, giving hospitals more patients now
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop
I'm just as angry another person got shot
Don’t be angry at the color of they skin
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and
I’ma tell you what I need right now
I’ma tell you what we all need
I need my people of color...
Don’t run from Trump, run against him

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top

I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor
Couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short

That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets

Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"

Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
[Verse 2]
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

Llama a su amiga, no le gusta salir sola
Y de la noche, dejarse llevar, oh...

Tú eres mi bebé, no te me salgas de al frente
Báilalo fuerte ¿qué importa la gente?
Algarete, no importa la gente
To' eso es pa' mí, bailando te di fuete
No hay más na', te diré

Que quite la paciencia y te sueltes las piernas

A ti te gusta y a mí también
Que nos pasemos las noches dándole

Pa' que pienses en mí como yo pienso en ti

[Verso]
Yo quiero hablarte, quiero hipnotizarte
Una estrella traerte, hasta el cielo bajarte
Cantarte al oído y ver tu piel al erizarte
Llevarte lentamente donde estemos tú y yo aparte
Y si te provoca, te beso la boca
Sueño con tocarte, quitarte la ropa
No confundas mi intención por decir cosas locas
Te quiero pero tu cuerpo también me provoca
Poderte complacer, cada uno de tus sueños conocer
Hablar juntos hasta el amanecer
Que seas mi mujer, ser yo el único que te dé placer
Y cada día de mi vida yo poderte tener
[Coro]
Voy buscando una lady como tú, la quiero así
Quiero que te enamores como estoy yo de ti
A casa enviarte flores y en tu nombre escribir

Pa' que pienses en mí como yo pienso en ti
Voy buscando una lady como tú, la quiero así
Quiero que te enamores como estoy yo de ti
A casa enviarte flores y en tu nombre escribir

You see I never took you for the poppin' type (Straight up)
Damn, it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (It's lit)

Drop off a bag of some dangerous (Yeah)

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things

Saw you there, and I thought

You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""

Ain't it funny? Rumors fly

Grab your passport and my hand

'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Oh, no

Rose garden filled with thorns

But you'll come back each time you leave

Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care, but we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

[Bridge]
Midnight, we're fading
Till daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with
All the heartache and the treason
The fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancing with us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)
Dancing with us, us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

When them boys talk loose and tell you power's for a king (huh?)
You just play it cool and tell 'em power's not a thing (what?)

You know there's power in a couple, let me compliment your vibe, yo

Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)

Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been livin', but I was never breathing
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (yaah!)

Payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest
(I'm the baddest, I'm the baddest...)
Go

[Verse 1]
Now, I'm out here lookin' like revenge
Feelin' like a ten, the best I've ever been
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (Wait a minute)
Now, you're out here lookin' like regret, ain't too proud to beg
Second chance, you'll never get
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (Wait a minute)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest
You fuckin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this (Ah)
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but nah

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Bein' so bad got me feelin' so good
Showin' you up like I knew that I would
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Feelin' inspired 'cause the tables have turned
Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that it burns
[Verse 2]
Baby, fineness is the way to kill
Tell me how it feel, bet it's such a bitter pill
And yeah I know, you thought you had bigger, better things
Bet right now this stings (Wait a minute)
'Cause the grass is greener under me
Bright as Technicolor, I can tell that you can see
And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (Wait a minute)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest
You fuckin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this (Ah)
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but nah

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Bein' so bad got me feelin' so good
Showin' you up like I knew that I would
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Feelin' inspired 'cause the tables have turned
Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that it burns
[Bridge]
Talk that talk, baby
Better walk, better walk that walk, baby
If you talk, if you talk that talk, baby
Better walk, better walk that walk, baby
Oh, yeah, talk that talk, baby
Better walk, better walk, that walk, baby
If you talk, if you talk that talk, baby
Better walk, better walk that walk, baby (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Bein' so bad got me feelin' so good
Showin' you up like I knew that I would
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)

You know I'm back, like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (Been going in)
Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like ""Woo, that boy got bars""
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious"

One, one, one, one, one

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Refrain]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new)

You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)

Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Intro: Gente de Zona]
¡Gente de Zona!
Lo mejor que suena ahora
JLo

[Verso 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Como en la vida, el amor es así
Nace de la nada y se convierte en todo
Nunca imaginé enamorarme así
No tenías previsto sentir amor

[Pre-Coro: Jennifer Lopez]
El amor es así
Inspirador, cautivador
Conmovedor, provocador
Y a veces tentación
El amor es así
Controlador, es dictador
Emocionante, apasionante
Depredador

[Coro: Jennifer Lopez & Gente de Zona / both]
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
[Verso 2: Jennifer Lopez & Gente de Zona / both]
Nada de lo que hagamos ahora es inmoral porque Cupido ya flechó
Si el amor es inmortal entonces la inmortalidad nos eligió
Tus labios son agua pura y mi mirada ya refleja el Kamasutra
Me gusta mi cama, pero prefiero la tuya

[Pre-Coro: Jennifer Lopez]
El amor es así
Inspirador, cautivador
Conmovedor, provocador
Y a veces tentación
El amor es así
Controlador, es dictador
Emocionante, apasionante
Depredador

[Coro: Jennifer Lopez & Gente de Zona / both]

Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
[Verso 3: Gente de Zona]
Que sea lo que Dios quiera
Yo quiero vivir contigo
Lo hacemos a tu manera
Porque a mi me da lo mismo
Que sea lo que Dios quiera
Yo quiero vivir contigo
Lo hacemos a tu manera

[Coro: Jennifer Lopez & Gente de Zona / both]
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó

Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

[Outro: Gente de Zona]
Que sea lo que Dios quiera (¡Motif! Yo te lo dije)
Lo hacemos a tu manera (Magnus, pero esta vez es con JLo)
Que sea lo que Dios quiera (lo mejor que suena ahora)
Lo hacemos a tu manera (desde Cuba, vamos a ver hasta que suba)"

No time for restin' (restin')
My life's invested in bein' a fuckin' legend (legend)
An icon, tryna cement it ('ment it)
I'm treatin' every year like it's game 7 (game 7)
I feel like problems in my city been deaded (deaded)
I feel like me and my niggas are unthreatened (threatened)
My new girl hate it when I'm always spendin' (all the time)
I guess I gotta get used to it 'cause of my exes
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)

She, she say the baby mine's, that's a lie (that's a lie)
If I ain't the hottest in the city, that's a lie (that's a lie)
School, teach you how to read the lines (read the lines)
In these streets, gotta read between the lines
Room, room full of ether clouds, you don't want no smoke
'Fore, before I choke, baby, I'ma choke 'em from their choker (yeah)
Only the red in my eyes see where you come from
We, we the gang, either you run with or run from

I got it a little cheap, baby you should come and play
Daddy will pay the cab, maybe stay for a day
No one got it but me
Bitches, they call me whore, son, more buns
Mami bent over for hum
Give her, what she want and let her get it good
Put it on her tongue
Told me, ""Charly, boy you gotta give
Fix me with a lot of dick
Hit me with a lot of kick
Show me you the man""
Bustin' quickies and dippin'
That be somethin' I can't stand
Other plans, baby, had of late
Tried to put me in a twirl like the Cheerio
I ain't talkin' cereal
Put me in a video, I can make a wave
Baby girl, comin' home and you can't stay, oww

You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I’m trying to turn k’s to m’s, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

[Outro: Chris Martin]
In you I see someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong"

I remember talking and drinking what we could find
Burnin' all those candles and stayin' up through the night
We'd make reservations for the places we know we'd never try
But then oh, we found some rich love
I remember feeling broke as a bottle of wine
I didn't move to the city to count all my pennies
And worship the Hollywood sign
She'll say, ""Hey man, nice to meet you,""
And she'll take every one last time
And I know, 'cause I found some fake love

Ooh, broke as a bottle of wine
Ooh, but drink with you all damn night
Ooh, not trying to trade up

We would piss off the neighbors
They'd eventually call the cops
And I was saving up for something, hoping life would finally start

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming) Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling) Confusing what is real"

They say that I don’t belong
Say that I should retreat

Of a lonesome defeat

Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out

Can't contain him, he knows he works

Dime, quítame esta duda

Porque ya tú no me tocas como lo hacía esa mujer
Algo no anda bien
Escucha las palabras de Romeo

¿Dónde fue bajo la lluvia que te di ese primer beso?
Dime también, relátame el momento
Número de alojamiento donde yo te hice mujer

Y le pongo fin a la impostora, usurpadora
Exijo contigo una entrevista

Dime, tengo unas preguntas

I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet

Que sea un buen amigo pero más un buen amante

De los que te abren la puerta y te mandan flores
A mí me gustan más grandes

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose

I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrive in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott
[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look

Uno de nosotros es de barrio fino
Un tipo muy real (The Big Boss)
Nos jugó una apuesta, que ni te miremos
Que te va a robar (Tamo' ready)
El otro es medio loco, con veinte tatuajes
Y ese swing de calle (Dimelo papi)
Y en su Lamborghini, con labia salvaje
Quiere impresionarte
El tercero es un poeta, trae serenatas
Brilla como el sol (Sólo escucha)
El chico de las poesías
Atentamente, tu servidor

Romeo te habla bonito y Yankee tiene a Yamilette
Yo te hago travesuras, mami hasta el amanecer
Tengo lo que hace falta para hacerte enloquecer
Por eso te pregunto si quieres ser mi mujer
¿Con quién te vas? Tengo la curiosidad
Dime si soy yo, dame la oportunidad
Yo seré un loquito pero puedo amarte
Dime mamacita, porque quiero llevarte

Si quieres una película, mami, yo tengo los tickets
Si estás enfermita te doy mi Robitussin
Conviértete en mi rusa, ponteme media Putin
Nicky vuela como un fénix y Romeo, el bachata king
Pero sigo siendo el mejor libra por libra en el ring
Baby, yo sé que está difícil la decisión
Reconoce que aquí no hay liga, yo soy tu opción
Yo sé que seras mía-ía

Was telling everyone it's not that bad
’Til all my shit hit the fan

Exorcise the demons inside me

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I used to pray to hear my songs on the radio
Growin' up, my folk was on, ain't have to kick a door
Keep sixty bitches backstage, at like every show
Ain’t no more Hanes on my balls, these are Kenneth Cole
All these squares in my pictures, yeah, we croppin' those
Let lil' shawty lick my dick, I had my boxers on
Everybody 'round me poppin, bitch, we kettle corn
Fly the PJ on the e-way with the P1
Carat and a half drippin' on my neck, son (Ho-oh-oh-oh)
Take a bubble bath with a rapper's baby mama (Oh, na-na-na-na-na)
Young dirty nigga rockin' water like a swamp (Woah-woah-oh-oh)
Yeah, I just fucked her last night, didn't tell her my name (Na-na-na-na-na-na)
All these hip-hop rappers down to be Drake (Na-na)
All my double cups purple like the soul plane (Na-na-na-na-na)
Diamonds on me loud, got you silent (Hoo-ayy)
Got her bouncin' on this dick like hydraulics

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go low, mane

Young, young nigga, same OG, stayin' lowkey
Stand ten toes deep, roll fleeces
G says, made a thesis, I'm a G
I'm a weakness like The Weeknd, so the remix...
I beg your pardon? It's true
The rumors that they start could make us break apart
Assumin' it influenced, all this sudden change of heart
Divorce in court and take off with the whole thing
'Mind 'em that they know me
No way you think if ever I decide to cut my hair like Abel did
Like Jaden Smith I'd prolly walk around all day with it
Okay, you lame, I'm a-okay with it
Might take the whip around my old ways
'Mind them that they know me

[Intro: Sebastián Yatra]
Yatra, Yatra

[Verso 1: Sebastián Yatra & Carlos Vives]
Son muchos años que pasaron sin decir te quiero
Y en verdad te quiero
Pero encuentro formas de engañar mi corazón
Son muchos años que pasaron sin robarte un beso
Sólo quiero un beso
Y por esa boca no me importa ser ladrón
No puede ser que no he encontrado todavía las palabras
Y en esa noche no dije nada
No puede ser que en un segundo me perdí en tu mirada
Cuando por dentro yo te gritaba

[Coro: Sebastián Yatra, Carlos Vives]
Déjame robarte un beso que me llegue hasta el alma
Como un vallenato de esos viejos que nos gustaban
Sé que sientes mariposas, yo también sentí sus alas
Déjame robarte un beso que te enamore y tú no te vayas
Déjame robarte un beso que me llegue hasta el alma
Como un vallenato de esos viejos que nos gustaban
Sé que sientes mariposas, yo también sentí sus alas
Déjame robarte un beso que te enamore y tú no te vayas
[Verso 2: Sebastián Yatra & Carlos Vives]
Déjame robarte el corazón
Déjame escribirte una canción
Déjame que con un beso nos perdamos los dos
Déjame robarte el corazón
Déjame subirle a esta canción
Para que bailemos juntos como nadie bailó

[Coro: Sebastián Yatra & Carlos Vives]
Déjame robarte un beso que me llegue hasta el alma
Como un vallenato de esos viejos que nos gustaban
Sé que sientes mariposas, yo también sentí sus alas
Déjame robarte un beso que te enamore y tú no te vayas

[Puente: Carlos Vives]
Yo sé que a ti te gusta que yo te cante así
Que tú te pones seria pero te hago reír
Que sé que tú me quieres por qué tú eres así
Y cuando estamos juntos ya no se que decir
Yo sé que a ti te gusta que yo te cante así
Que tú te pones seria pero te hago reír
Que sé que tú me quieres porque tú eres así
Y cuando estamos juntos ya no sé qué decir

[Coro: Sebastián Yatra, Carlos Vives & Ambos]
Déjame robarte un beso que me llegue hasta el alma
Como un vallenato de esos viejos que nos gustaban
Sé que sientes mariposas (sé que sientes mariposas)
Yo también sentí sus alas (yo también sentí sus alas)
Déjame robarte un beso que te enamore y tú no te vayas
Déjame robarte un beso que me llegue hasta el alma

Can’t nobody get up in my car today
Back seat feeling like a charter plane
Bumping Silkk Da Shocker Charge It 2 Da Game
Paint dripping like I’m whipping marmalade (whoa)
Look at the way that I’m shining
I don’t be checking the mileage
She said how much is that Rolie?
I said don’t worry I’m timeless
Watching Toy Story 3, that’s a great fucking movie
City of Jimi, Kurt, Quincy
City of me, Eddie, and Bruce Lee (whoa)
King of the road I drive slow like whoa
And I just switched over to Geico like whoa
Celebrating these life goals
But you ain’t getting no ride home

[Chorus]
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face

I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town

All eyes on me now
I be riding through Seatown
Taking pics when I eat out
Girls ask me to freestyle
Neighbors hate it when I speed out
I ain’t turning these beats down
GPS and I reroute
Chuck the deuce and I peace out
Sun roof tinted, don't need your opinions
I be on my business, and you be on Tinder
And if I was single, I’d be right there with ya
But I’m committed, keep my dick in my britches
The women are moving their bodies
Sunset through numerous palm trees
Followed by the paparazzi
But they don’t get into our party
Tell the bell hop that I’m sorry
We 40 deep in the lobby
Travel the world with a posse
But soon I’ll be home
So call up my momma and tell her to pick up the phone
Cause I need that homemade lasagna that’s fresh out the stove
Grabbing the keys and I’m fresh out the door
King of my city whose next on the throne
[Chorus]
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face

I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
When you hear that speaker sound, ound, ound
You know who it is, Lil Boat in your town
Whoa this beat so happy I will never frown
And my hair so nappy it’s gonna be a problem braiding it down
Oh no, oh no, we been grinding from the go
Jump start, I just bought a new whip, push start
Push the coup down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart
Pure art
I think they mad because I broke into the game with a crowbar
Top the charts, Hip Hop ain’t the same we the new stars
Rock stars, look at all my chains call them ice pops
Ring pops, let the rain drop on the wrist watch
Fuck the cops, and fuck Donald Trump, bitch it’s Macklemore and Lil Boat
Anything else you need to know

I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face

200 cajas 'e paper que pedí en eBay
En PR ya es legal, yo firmé la ley
Fumando como Snoop Dogg y Wiz Kha
Las gatas quieren Kush, no quieren Friska
Prendí un bastón como el de la brisca
2 phillies, se queda bizca
Lo que tú estás haciendo yo lo hice primero
Bebé, ese novio tuyo es medio culero
Yo ando por New York con un par de cueros
Y pila e' cuarto pa' to's estos cabrones hacerles fiero
Yo tengo agricultores como Piculín
Los ojos rojos como el Chapulín
Hoy se me olvido beberme la Ritalin
Pero las 602 las bajé con Lean

La vida es una y la tengo que aprovechar
No sé si esto es un sueño o será real
Antes de irme pa' otro mundo te quiero probar

Pa'l carajo el mañana, sólo pienso en hoy

Them niggas that post in the back don't say nothin'
Them niggas will kill for me
Back ends I count in my sleep, on fleek
Hundred K spent on a Patek Phillippe (Phillippe)
Bitch, I'm a dog, eat my treat (Hrr)
Hop out the frog and leap (Leap)
I put them bricks in the fender
My bitch, she walk around like she Kris Jenner (Kris Jenner)
I used to break in and enter
Then Takeoff runnin' like the game of temple (Whew)
It's simple, I play with her mental
Mama said she saw me on Jimmy Kimmel (Mama)
Count it up, 'cause I'm a money symbol
Walkin' with the racks, I'm lookin' crippled (Money)
Fuck on that bitch then I tip her (Tip her)
A nickel for me to take pictures (Nickel)

Convertible Wop, convertible top
My dope got a vertical, look at it hop
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, and it jump out the pot (Pot)
Came out of jail and went straight to the top
Take it easy, baby, middle of summer, I'm freezin', baby (Burr)
Don't leave me, baby
Just drop to your knees and please me, baby (Go)
I'm fascinated, two bitches so fine that I masturbated (Ha)
Congratulations, she brain me so good that I graduated (Wow)
They had to hate it
I don't fuck with them niggas, they plastic, baby (Heh)

We were talkin’ for a minute

You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

You probably didn’t think that it was true

El novio la hizo llorar, mató sus sentimiento'
Prometió palabra' que se fueron con el viento
Ahora ella le dice: ""Lo lamento, lo siento""

Se monta en su nave a quemar la carretera

Dale champán y se prende en candela, esa e' mi nena

Take a shot in the face of fear
Fist up in the firing line

Breaking all those promises made
Times are changing

17
A collection of nightmares, thoughts, and real-life situations I've lived
17 is the number tattooed on the right side of my head
My own personal number
Soon to be explained in future interviews or instances
By listening to this album, you are literally
And I cannot stress this enough, literally entering my mind
And if you are not willing to accept my emotion and hear my words fully, do not listen
I do not value your money; I value your acceptance and loyalty
Here is my pain and thoughts put into words
I put my all into this
In the hopes that it will help cure, or at least numb your depression
I love you, thank you for listening
Enjoy"

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

Touch me and you'll never be alone

You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

When you say that you love me
I walk above the clouds
Tell me about eternity just one more time
When you say that you love me
All I need is that one phrase
That you'll never change, just one more time
You're like the whole world to me
Hug me harder and more painfully
That something that we shared
And you can't make it nothing (Nothing)
I hope you don't forget that you're my

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, V]
Day by day
Summer, winter
Even if you don’t know

You got the best of me
You got the best of me
So please just don't leave me
You got the best of me

[Verse 2: RM, SUGA]
Even though I haven't seen my limits
But if it exists, It's probably you
I wanted to be the tender waves
But why didn't I know you were the sea?
What do I do?
I speak with your language
And I breathe in your air
I'll be you, I'll be in your grasp
As I kiss your sword
So take my hand right now
I don't believe that I'm like this
The words I've said to myself a million times
Please don't leave me, ooh-woah
You got the best of me, you got the best of me
It's not important if it's a dream or reality
Only the fact that you're by my side (Thanks)

I stop all the misfortune
And I bring the heavens
Don't speak of it so lightly
There's no me without you
You're the best of me, the best of me, yeah
[Verse 3: SUGA, j-hope]
You just give me the confidence within myself (Oh, yeah)
That's all I wanted (Woo, woo)
There may not be rules between us
But the way to love exists

No one knows, but I know me

TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me!

I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo

En garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like ""Woo, that boy got bars""
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo

You'll miss the magic of these good old days

I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days

Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

Can’t nobody get up in my car today
Back seat feeling like a charter plane
Bumping Silkk Da Shocker Charge It 2 Da Game
Paint dripping like I’m whipping marmalade (whoa)
Look at the way that I’m shining
I don’t be checking the mileage
She said how much is that Rolie?
I said don’t worry I’m timeless
Watching Toy Story 3, that’s a great fucking movie
City of Jimi, Kurt, Quincy
City of me, Eddie, and Bruce Lee (whoa)
King of the road I drive slow like whoa
And I just switched over to Geico like whoa
Celebrating these life goals
But you ain’t getting no ride home

I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face

All eyes on me now
I be riding through Seatown
Taking pics when I eat out
Girls ask me to freestyle
Neighbors hate it when I speed out
I ain’t turning these beats down
GPS and I reroute
Chuck the deuce and I peace out
Sun roof tinted, don't need your opinions
I be on my business, and you be on Tinder
And if I was single, I’d be right there with ya
But I’m committed, keep my dick in my britches
The women are moving their bodies
Sunset through numerous palm trees
Followed by the paparazzi
But they don’t get into our party
Tell the bell hop that I’m sorry
We 40 deep in the lobby
Travel the world with a posse
But soon I’ll be home
So call up my momma and tell her to pick up the phone
Cause I need that homemade lasagna that’s fresh out the stove
Grabbing the keys and I’m fresh out the door
King of my city whose next on the throne

When you hear that speaker sound, ound, ound
You know who it is, Lil Boat in your town
Whoa this beat so happy I will never frown
And my hair so nappy it’s gonna be a problem braiding it down
Oh no, oh no, we been grinding from the go
Jump start, I just bought a new whip, push start
Push the coup down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart
Pure art
I think they mad because I broke into the game with a crowbar
Top the charts, Hip Hop ain’t the same we the new stars
Rock stars, look at all my chains call them ice pops
Ring pops, let the rain drop on the wrist watch
Fuck the cops, and fuck Donald Trump, bitch it’s Macklemore and Lil Boat
Anything else you need to know

¿Dónde vas? Si estoy loco por tenerte
Cómo lo iba a saber
Que te vería otra vez

Tú me confundes, no sé qué hacer
Yo lo que quiero es pasarla bien
Yo tengo miedo de que me guste
Y que vaya a enloquecer

Yo tengo miedo de que me guste

Te hablo en serio mai, no estoy jugando
Tanto tiempo pasa y nada
Estas ganas no me aguanto
Y aunque tú me esquives, yo te sigo deseando
Dicen que tú eres peligrosa
No le hago caso a esas cosas
Dime qué está pasando
Me tienes como un loco, soy un loco enamorado, eh
Quiero saber cuánto me vas a insistir
Y hasta dónde llegarías por mí
Siento mucho la espera
Pero valdrá la pena cuando te esté besando
De la manera que te mueves así
Yo te lo juro me voy a derretir
Tú sabes que soy buena
Por más que yo te esquive me sigues deseando

Quiero un tipo atento y cariñoso
Pero que no sea muy celoso
Que en la calle sea un príncipe
Pero que en mi cama sea salvaje y peligroso

You got a way of makin' me feel insane
Like I can't trust my own brain
Unless it's screaming your name
I'd have it no other way
I'd have it no other way
And maybe that's why I stay
How many times can we pick up the same fight?
Can we keep screaming all night
And make up until it's light?
That's when I say that you're right
And feel your body on mine
Oh maybe that's why I stay

[Chorus]
I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love

[Verse 2]
Keep comin' back, guess you could say I'm attached
Last time we called it a wrap, I came beggin' and all that
You're like a habit, it's bad
I got a habit, it's bad
Oh no, I'm not even mad

I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love

It's the way you keep me up all night
It's the way you make me lose my mind
Every time I'm sayin' one more night
It's the way you know I'm yours
It's the way you know I'm yours for life

'Cause I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy

Tú cierras los ojos y piensa en mi nombre
Pero te das cuenta que ahora hay otro hombre

You hit the ATM
In my Mercedes Benz
With all your lady
Friends—whores!
Hit the club and you go out
Don't know a sum, 'cause when I calculate
The times you cheated
And I total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up
'Cause you say that just givin' out your number doesn't count
Get it? (I hate you)
Then see me with someone new
Get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me
Then tell me that I stabbed you in it?!
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Slut!
So when you're driving
Driving to his house
And you pass me
While I'm drivin' to hers
Just remember
You cheated on me first (Bitch!)
You're a whore, you're a whore (Eminem!)
This is war (Fellas, ladies)

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows

Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over

God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot

Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you

And I remember everything

Drive highways and byways to be there with you

Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you

[Intro: Sebastián Yatra]
Oh no, no, no
Yatra, Yatra

[Verso 1: Sebastián Yatra]
Ella se va conmigo
Pero no soy su amigo
Desde hace mucho tiempo pude ser algo más
Y aunque su corazón tenga una clave
Nadie lo sabe pero tengo la llave
Desde hace mucho tiempo la aprendí a enamorar

[Coro: Sebastián Yatra]
Lo que le gusta es que le cante al oído en la noche
Que la mire y que le diga te quiero otra vez
Ella me pide que le dé el corazón sólo a ella
Yo le digo que me tiene soñando otra vez

Lo que le gusta es que (otra vez, otra vez)
Ella me pide que (otra vez, otra vez)

[Verso 2: Dalmata]
Lo que le gusta es que le dé ram pam pa pa pam
Porque dice que le doy lo que otros no le dan
Dice que cuando yo estoy, las tristezas se van
Pero no estando yo, vuelve a sentirse tan sola
Como Eva en el paraíso sin Adán
Pasando las noches frías, los días sin sol
Pues soy yo el que le da calor (brrr) cuando tiene frío
Y nunca me quedo dormido (le doy cariño y amor antes)
Yo a ella la mimo, la consiento y la hago happy
Le digo mami te quiero y ella me dice I love you papi
Es fanática de como canto, yo soy fanático
De como ella baila, y rompe caderas como si fueran de plástico

[Puente: Dalmata]
Oh, wow, me tiene juquiao
Me tiene latiendo el corazón acelerao’ de tanto amor
Porque ella es mi super estrella, su galán soy yo
(Su galán soy yo)

[Coro: Sebastián Yatra]
Lo que le gusta es que le cante al oído en la noche
Que la mire y que le diga te quiero otra vez
Ella me pide que le dé el corazón sólo a ella
Yo le digo que me tiene soñando otra vez

Lo que le gusta es que (otra vez, otra vez)
Ella me pide que (otra vez, otra vez)
Yatra, Yatra

[Verso 3: Sebastián Yatra]
A ella le gusta como yo le canto
Y a mí me gusta su cara
Y me reclama que no soy un santo
Pero igualmente me llama
Porque no quiere estar sola
No la dejo sola
Y me da miedo estarme enamorando
Pero uno ama a quien ama

[Coro: Sebastián Yatra]
Lo que le gusta es que le cante al oído en la noche
Que la mire y que le diga te quiero otra vez
Ella me pide que le dé el corazón sólo a ella
Yo le digo que me tiene soñando otra vez

[Outro: Sebastián Yatra, Dalmata]
Lo que le gusta es que
Oh, wow, me tiene juquiao’
Oh, wow, me tiene juquiao’
Oh, wow, me tiene juquiao’
Oh, wow (otra vez, otra vez)
(Otra vez, otra vez)

Es porque la noche es mía

Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right

Let's turn off our phones tonight
And rely on the stars
We've been so lost lately
We forgot who we are
But I got everything I need, baby
In the palms of your touch
In a world of dark distractions
It can all get too much

[Chorus]
So let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time

[Verse 2]
I know you're feelin' weighed down tonight
And you can't find the breaks
Every day is too long for you
You are sworn to your fate
But we got everything we need, baby
In the memories we make
In a world of reinventions
It's never too late
[Chorus]
So let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time, mmm
Oh, so let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
There is nothin' that we've done wrong
That can't be made right
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it one day at a time"

A life, a life of stranger things (Very far)
The stranger things (Dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are

[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder]
We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
How we gonna get out?
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 2: Ryan Tedder]
I see your Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down

Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
Pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

Son muchos años que pasaron sin robarte un beso
Sólo quiero un beso

Y en esa noche no dije nada
No puede ser que en un segundo me perdí en tu mirada
